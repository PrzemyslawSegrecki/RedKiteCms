#RedKite CMS tests suite

RedKite CMS test suite is written for **PUPUnit** for unit testing while uses **Behat** for functional testing.

At the moment there are just some scenarios for this last testing tool but this lack will be covered in a short time and this document will be extended to give more information about this topic.
