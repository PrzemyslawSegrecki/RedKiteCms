#RedKite CMS Marketplace

Welcome to the RedKite CMS Marketplace, the place where you can get new blocks and themes to easily extend RedKite CMS. Do not forget that both themes and blocks are called plugins in the RedKite CMS ecosystem.

The most of those plugins live [in this github repository](https://github.com/redkite-labs/redkitecms-plugins) and are included by default into RedKite CMS, from alpha 3 release. 

Explore the documentation, using the menu on the left and learn how to use and improve them.

If you would like to share your plugins with the community, just follow [the instructions on this document](share-a-plugin).
