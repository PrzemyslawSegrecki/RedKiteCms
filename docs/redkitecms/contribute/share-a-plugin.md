## Share a Theme or Block
RedKite CMS 2 collects extra open sourced plugins [in this github repository](https://github.com/redkite-labs/redkitecms-plugins), so, when you would like to share a plugin, just follow these simple steps:

- [fork that repository](https://github.com/redkite-labs/redkitecms-plugins#fork-destination-box)
- clone it from your profile
- add themes under the **Theme** folder
- add blocks under the **Blocks** folder
- commit your changes
- when you are done, just send us a pull request

Your Theme or Block bundle will be evaluated and then it will be published.
